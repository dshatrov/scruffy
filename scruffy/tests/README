This catalogue contains tests for scruffy parser and code generator.
These tests are meant to drive the development process. Each test
is a feature request which is to be fulfilled.

A test passes if scruffy parses it correctly and generates equivalent
code as output.

Note that with these tests we don't check scruffy behavior for ill-formed
C++ code, since all tests are valid C++ programs.
